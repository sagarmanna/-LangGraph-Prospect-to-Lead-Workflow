# üöÄ LangGraph Prospect-to-Lead Workflow
 
*Visual representation of the modular AI-driven workflow.*

## Project Overview

This project implements an **autonomous AI-driven prospect-to-lead workflow** using **LangGraph + LangChain**. The system dynamically orchestrates multiple agents to:

- Discover B2B prospects  
- Enrich lead data  
- Score leads according to configurable ICP criteria  
- Generate and send personalized outreach  
- Track responses  
- Optimize campaign performance via feedback  

The workflow is fully configurable via `workflow.json` and is modular, allowing extensions with custom agents, APIs, and scoring logic.
